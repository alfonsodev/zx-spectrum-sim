A project for a website written with HTML/CSS3/JS and jQuery that should resemble an old application loaded and viewed from a ZX Spectrum. There are still a lot of things to do in this project, for example changing all the comments, name of the variables and of the functions from Italian to English.

See a demo of it in action here: http://demo.kaiko.it/zx-spectrum-sim/
